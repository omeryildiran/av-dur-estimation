================================================================================\nCOMPREHENSIVE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS REPORT\n================================================================================\n
1. SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS\n   • Number of participants: 12\n   • Number of models tested: 6\n   • Models: gaussian_contextualPrior, gaussian_sharedPrior, logLinearMismatch_contextualPrior, logLinearMismatch_sharedPrior, lognorm_contextualPrior, lognorm_sharedPrior\n
2. MODEL SELECTION RESULTS (AIC-based)\n   • lognorm_sharedPrior: 5/12 participants (41.7%)\n   • gaussian_contextualPrior: 2/12 participants (16.7%)\n   • logLinearMismatch_sharedPrior: 2/12 participants (16.7%)\n   • gaussian_sharedPrior: 2/12 participants (16.7%)\n   • lognorm_contextualPrior: 1/12 participants (8.3%)\n
3. AIC SUPPORT ANALYSIS\n   • No support: 29 model instances (40.3%)\n   • Substantial support: 16 model instances (22.2%)\n   • Best model: 12 model instances (16.7%)\n   • Considerable support: 8 model instances (11.1%)\n   • Some support: 7 model instances (9.7%)\n
4. GROUP-LEVEL STATISTICAL TESTS\n   • Friedman test performed on AIC values across models\n   • Tests for parameter differences between models\n
5. EFFECT SIZES AND PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE\n   • gaussian_contextualPrior: Mean ΔAIC = 21.29 ± 22.92 (Poor support on average)\n   • gaussian_sharedPrior: Mean ΔAIC = 23.12 ± 25.84 (Poor support on average)\n   • logLinearMismatch_contextualPrior: Mean ΔAIC = 10.31 ± 12.24 (Poor support on average)\n   • logLinearMismatch_sharedPrior: Mean ΔAIC = 9.82 ± 14.17 (Poor support on average)\n   • lognorm_contextualPrior: Mean ΔAIC = 5.47 ± 7.11 (Some to considerable support on average)\n   • lognorm_sharedPrior: Mean ΔAIC = 5.73 ± 8.97 (Some to considerable support on average)\n
6. INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES\n   • Participants with clear model preference (ΔAIC > 2): 3/12 (25.0%)\n   • Participants with ambiguous model preference: 9/12 (75.0%)\n
7. RECOMMENDATIONS\n   • No single model dominates across participants\n   • Consider individual differences in model selection\n   • Mixed-effects or hierarchical modeling may be appropriate\n   • High proportion of ambiguous cases suggests model complexity may be similar\n   • Consider parsimony principle and practical interpretability\n
8. TECHNICAL NOTES\n   • AIC differences interpreted using Burnham & Anderson (2002) guidelines\n   • BIC differences interpreted using Kass & Raftery (1995) guidelines\n   • Bayes factors approximated using BIC (Wagenmakers, 2007)\n   • Non-parametric tests used due to potential non-normality\n
