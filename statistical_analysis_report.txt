================================================================================\nCOMPREHENSIVE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS REPORT\n================================================================================\n
1. SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS\n   • Number of participants: 12\n   • Number of models tested: 3\n   • Models: gaussian, logLinearMismatch, lognorm\n
2. MODEL SELECTION RESULTS (AIC-based)\n   • gaussian: 4/12 participants (33.3%)\n   • lognorm: 4/12 participants (33.3%)\n   • logLinearMismatch: 4/12 participants (33.3%)\n
3. AIC SUPPORT ANALYSIS\n   • No support: 13 model instances (36.1%)\n   • Best model: 12 model instances (33.3%)\n   • Considerable support: 4 model instances (11.1%)\n   • Substantial support: 4 model instances (11.1%)\n   • Some support: 3 model instances (8.3%)\n
4. GROUP-LEVEL STATISTICAL TESTS\n   • Friedman test performed on AIC values across models\n   • Tests for parameter differences between models\n
5. EFFECT SIZES AND PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE\n   • gaussian: Mean ΔAIC = 21.71 ± 26.34 (Poor support on average)\n   • logLinearMismatch: Mean ΔAIC = 9.79 ± 15.20 (Poor support on average)\n   • lognorm: Mean ΔAIC = 8.09 ± 11.87 (Poor support on average)\n
6. INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES\n   • Participants with clear model preference (ΔAIC > 2): 10/12 (83.3%)\n   • Participants with ambiguous model preference: 2/12 (16.7%)\n
7. RECOMMENDATIONS\n   • No single model dominates across participants\n   • Consider individual differences in model selection\n   • Mixed-effects or hierarchical modeling may be appropriate\n
8. TECHNICAL NOTES\n   • AIC differences interpreted using Burnham & Anderson (2002) guidelines\n   • BIC differences interpreted using Kass & Raftery (1995) guidelines\n   • Bayes factors approximated using BIC (Wagenmakers, 2007)\n   • Non-parametric tests used due to potential non-normality\n
